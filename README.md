# SOLID Design Principle in Python

### I have written the codes in order, so that you can better understand the concept of solid principles, and how you can use them.

**SOLID Design Principles** help us to write clean code, easy to reuse and extend.

**SOLID** stands for 5 principle :

**[S]ingle Responsibility principle**.

**[O]pen/Closed principle**.

**[L]iskov Substitution principle**.

**[I]nterface Segregation principle**.

**[D]ependency Inversion principle**.

1- **Single Responsibility principle** : our classes and methods should have *high coheison*, and responsible only for one things.   
(Separation of Concerns)-different class handling
different and independent tasks.

2- **Open/Closed principle** : our modules should open to exension(be able to extend) but closed for modifications.

3- **Liskov Substitution principle** : we should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.

4- **Interface Segregation principle** : don't put too much into an interface, split it into separate interface.

5- **Dependency Inversion principle** : high-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones, use abstractions.
